## About Me

I started my cybersecurity journey as a self-learner. Later, I deepened my knowledge by completing two professional courses at the **Scientific Cyber Security Association**:

- **Ethical Hacking**  
- **Practical Cybersecurity**  

Additionally, I thoroughly completed all vulnerability labs on **PortSwigger Academy**, gaining hands-on experience in a wide range of web security vulnerabilities.

To further enhance my practical skills, I actively participated on **TryHackMe**, where I earned several certifications:  

- [Web Fundamentals](https://tryhackme-certificates.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/THM-UMIXQK7VO9.pdf)  
- [Introduction to Cyber Security](https://tryhackme-certificates.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/THM-70CJPJF0NW.png)  
- [Junior Penetration Tester](https://tryhackme-certificates.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/THM-DMN2YCUN9E.png)
